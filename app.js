// So far we have seen:
//
// Strings
// Numbers
// Booleans
// Arrays
// Objects
// When these datatypes are combined, we get a data structure, for example, an array that contains objects that each contain booleans.
//
// Let's say you are tasked with creating some software, and it is up to you to determine which datatypes and what data structure to use.
//
// Answer the Following
// For each of the following, write which datatypes you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the data structure:

// A light switch that can be either on or off.
// //A boolean where true: on and false: off
// if (lightswitch == 'on') {
//   return true;
// }
//
//
// // A user's email address.
// //a string b.c you need to be able to encompass numbers.
// windows.alert('Email address here, please:');
//
// // A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
// //an object named spaceship.
// const spaceschip = {
//   hull: '',
//   laser blaster: true,
//   tractor beam: '25 feet',
//   warp drive: 10
// }
//
// // A list of student names from our class.
// //an array b.c that's all you need.
// const namesOfPartyPotensh = [];
//
// // A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
// an object with a key: value pair
// // const names = {
//  [
//   name: location
// ]

// A list of student names from our class, each with a location and
//each with a list of favorite tv shows.

// // an object.
// const profiles = {
//   name: '',
//   location: '',
//   favorite tv shows: [
//
//   ]
//   }
// }

Make an array that holds all of the colors of the rainbow.
Write code that will access "blue" from the rainbow array.
Make an object that is called your name and holds the information about your favorite food, a hobby, the name of the town that you live in currently, and your favorite datatype.
Write code that will access your hobby from the object that you just created.
